# Electricity Consumption Analysis Project

## Overview:
Our project utilizes Tableau to analyze electricity consumption patterns across Indian states for 2019 and 2020. By exploring state-wise data, seasonal trends, and event-specific impacts like Diwali, we uncover valuable insights into energy usage behaviors.

## Key Visualizations:

 - Total State-Wise Consumption (HBar): Visualizes electricity usage across states using a horizontal bar chart.
 - State Consumption Distribution (Treemap): Maps out consumption patterns across states with a treemap visualization.
 - Geographical Distribution: Illustrates consumption variations across India's regions through a comprehensive map.
 - Annual Regional Trends (Line Chart): Tracks annual consumption trends per region, highlighting year-over-year changes.
 - Diwali 2019 Impact (HBar): Analyzes electricity consumption during the festive period of Diwali in 2019.
 - Seasonal Consumption Patterns (Line Chart): Depicts seasonal variations in consumption across different regions.
 - Weekdays vs. Weekends (Stacked Bar): Compares consumption patterns between weekdays and weekends across regions.

## Conclusion:
Our project delivers comprehensive insights into electricity consumption trends, aiding stakeholders in optimizing energy strategies and resource management effectively.
